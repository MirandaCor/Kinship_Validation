The purpose of this section is to compare non-genetic data with likelihood ratios (LR) obtained from pairwise analysis. Since kinship assumptions are necessary in this 
exercise—given that missing person case files do not include registered familial relationships—verification is only possible with respect to the missing person. However, 
conducting this analysis within a relatives' database is crucial.

One key reason is that establishing biological relationships is essential when constructing pedigrees that connect relatives' databases with victims' databases. Additionally, 
a single relative may be linked to multiple missing person case files. If these biological relationships are not accounted for, some matches may appear highly significant due 
to elevated likelihood ratios and could be mistakenly interpreted as advantageous matches when, in reality, they reflect an existing kinship.

Furthermore, in cases where direct profiles of the victim are unavailable, or when the available relatives provide limited genetic information—such as the absence of direct 
ascendants or descendants (e.g., parents or children)—these established relationships can be leveraged. Advanced techniques, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), can provide 
additional evidence to confirm biological relationships.

Another critical aspect of this analysis is the integration of non-genetic data with pairwise results to identify potential relationships. Within the same case file, certain 
relatives are more likely to share biological ties. However, in complex family structures, this is not always the case, making it essential to flag such possibilities for further
investigation. Additionally, comparing surnames across different case files can help uncover previously unknown relationships, whether between the donors of biological samples or 
among reported missing persons. 

While it is not possible to fully verify all data in the context of this exercise, within a forensic laboratory, a more selective approach can be applied to determine 
which features are most relevant for confirming these relationships.
