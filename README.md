# Kinship_validation
PairWise analyst of samples within a family reference database is crucial for ensuring the consistency of likelihood ratios, both among relatives and when compared to unrelated records. This process is especially important because, during the search for family members, human remains may match two family references with genetically similar profiles. Such matches might suggest a biological relationship between the references or could simply arise from genetic variation within the population. In some cases, common alleles prevalent in the population can lead to random similarities across a significant portion of their genetic profiles, resulting in apparent matches that require careful interpretation.

We manage a partial, real database of family reference profiles, assuming a relationship between those profiles that report the same missing person. We calculate likelihood ratios to test hypotheses of paternity and full siblingship. Additionally, we compare these profiles with other records, ensuring that they do not share last names with family references or reported missing persons categorized as unrelated. Based on these comparisons, we classify records as either potentially related or with insufficient data, helping to confirm or exclude possible relationships. While this approach is not the most reliable method for confirming kinship within a database (as it is always preferable to ask families about other missing relatives), it serves as a preliminary step for performing peer verifications within the data.

In this exercise, we applied the rapid algorithm approach of the ScreenMatch tool in DNAView software (version 37.57) and managed the data using R software (version 4.3.2) along with RStudio (Build 561).
